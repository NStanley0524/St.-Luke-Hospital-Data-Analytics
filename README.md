# St.-Luke-s-Hospital-Data-Analytics
Data-driven analysis and visualization of St. Luke’s Hospital's operations, patient care, financial performance, and resource optimization using Excel.



## Overview
This project focuses on St. Luke’s Hospital and applies data analytics techniques using Excel to optimize hospital operations, improve financial management, and enhance patient care. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset, the project provides insights into key performance metrics, including emergency room visits, revenue streams, staffing, and patient care efficiency. The goal is to transform raw hospital data into actionable insights to streamline decision-making and improve hospital performance.


## Key Features
- Data Cleanng and Anallysis: Preprocessing of patient demographics, hospital visits, financial data, medical staff, and emergency & ICU records to ensure accurate and structured insights.
- Data Visualization: Use of Excel charts and pivot tables to present financial trends, patient trends, and staff workloads.
- Revenue Analysis: Evaluation of hospital revenue streams, financial performance, and identification of inefficiencies or growth opportunities.
- Emergency Room Efficiency: Analysis of ER visits, ambulance arrivals, and average time spent in the ER to optimize operational efficiency.
- Patient Care Optimization: Tracking patient admissions, bed usage, and the correlation between chronic conditions and length of hospital stays.
- Staffing Analysis: Evaluation of doctor and nurse-to-patient ratios to ensure adequate staffing and balance workload distribution across departments.
- Insurance Coverage: Analyzing the impact of different insurance types on hospital revenue and identifying gaps in coverage.


## Dataset
The dataset includes the following:
1. Patients Data: Demographics, insurance type, BMI, chronic conditions, and satisfaction scores.
2. Hospital Visits: Patient admissions, discharge dates, length of stay, medical condition, department, and readmission status.
3. Financial Data: Billing details, total bill amount, insurance coverage, and outstanding balances.
4. Medical Staff: Doctor details, department specialization, and nurse-to-patient ratios.
5. Emergency & ICU Data: Emergency visits, ambulance arrivals, time spent in ER, and ICU admissions.

## General Insights and Rccommendations
1. Financial Performance: The overall hospital revenue has fluctuated, with some departments showing consistent growth while others are underperforming. This indicates a need for targeted financial strategies in certain areas to optimize hospital resources.
2. Patient Care Optimization: The dashboard highlights trends in patient admissions and bed occupancy, suggesting that certain departments experience higher patient volumes, leading to potential delays in care. Optimizing staffing and resource allocation during peak times can help manage this issue.
3. Emergency Room Efficiency: Emergency Room visits have been consistently high, with long wait times noted during peak hours. This suggests a need to improve patient flow and staff availability during high-demand times to ensure timely care.
4. Staffing Levels: The dashboard shows an imbalance in staffing across departments. Some departments are overstaffed, while others suffer from inadequate staffing. A review of staffing levels and workload distribution across departments could improve both staff satisfaction and patient care quality.
5. Insurance Coverage: A significant portion of patient bills is not covered by insurance, leading to high outstanding balances. This highlights potential gaps in insurance coverage and points to a need for better insurance management strategies.


## Recommendations
1. Financial Growth: Focus on expanding high-performing departments and review underperforming ones to identify potential inefficiencies or opportunities for growth.
2. Optimize Resource Allocation: Use the data from patient admissions and department performance to optimize resource distribution, particularly during peak hours, to improve both patient care and staff workload.
3. Emergency Room Staffing: Increase staffing during high-demand times, or implement better scheduling strategies to ensure adequate coverage during peak ER hours.
4. Balance Staffing Across Departments: Perform a detailed review of staffing levels to ensure they align with patient volume and department needs. This could help reduce staff burnout and improve patient care efficiency.
5. Review Insurance Partnerships: Collaborate with insurance providers to address the gaps in coverage, reducing the number of unpaid balances and improving financial health for the hospital.
